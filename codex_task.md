# Codex o3 Task: Notion Data Analysis and Mapping

## Context
Claude Code is extracting Notion data for you since you don't have direct MCP access. The data will be saved in JSON format for your analysis.

## Your Task: Deep Analysis of Notion Data

### 1. Read the Notion Data
Read the file at: `/Users/jamesbrady/Desktop/ai_trinity_workspace/data_extraction_project/notion_for_codex.json`

### 2. Analyze the Structure
- Identify all databases and their schemas
- Map relationships between different databases
- Identify key fields and data types
- Document the information architecture

### 3. Extract Key Insights
- What types of information are stored in Notion?
- What are the most active/updated areas?
- Identify any project management structures
- Find knowledge management patterns
- Detect any task/goal tracking systems

### 4. Create Visual Data Map
Generate a comprehensive map showing:
- Database relationships
- Information flow
- Key entities (projects, tasks, notes, etc.)
- Connection points with other systems

Save as: `notion_data_map.md` with ASCII diagrams or structured markdown

### 5. Identify Integration Opportunities
Based on your analysis:
- How can Notion data enhance the Cloze CRM data?
- What automations could be beneficial?
- Which data should be synchronized?
- What insights emerge from combining both datasets?

### 6. Generate Recommendations
Create actionable recommendations for:
- Data organization improvements
- Workflow optimizations
- Integration strategies
- Automation opportunities

Save as: `notion_analysis_recommendations.md`

### 7. Prepare Combined Insights
After Claude Code provides the Cloze data:
- Read `cloze_contacts_full.json` and other Cloze files
- Find correlations between Notion and Cloze data
- Identify shared entities (people, projects, companies)
- Create a unified view of the data landscape

Save as: `unified_data_insights.md`

## Output Summary
Create a final report that synthesizes:
1. Notion workspace structure
2. Key findings from the analysis
3. Integration recommendations
4. Unified data model proposal

Save as: `notion_analysis_complete.md`

Remember to use your advanced reasoning capabilities to find patterns and insights that might not be immediately obvious!
